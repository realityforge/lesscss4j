/**
 * Implementation of the {@link TransformerManager} that looks up {@link Transformer} instances based on the class of
 * the provided object.  Instances of this class are provided with a <code>Map</code> that provides a mapping between
 * <code>Class</code> and {@link Transformer} instances.  The {@link Transformer} to use for a particular object is
 * determined as follows:
 * <p/>
 * <ol>
 * <li>If there is a <code>Class</code> in the given Map that matches the given object's <code>Class</code> exactly,
 * the associated {@link Transformer} is returned.</li>
 * <li>Iterate over the entries in the given <code>Map</code>.  For the first entry where the <code>Class</code> is a
 * superclass or interface implemented by the given object, the associated {@link Transformer} is returned.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p/>
 * As a result, it is highly recommended that the map provided to instances of this class return values from the
 * <code>entrySet</code> method in a consistent way. (i.e. something like <code>LinkedHashMap</code>)
